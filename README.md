Introducing the best solution for easily tracking and keeping an eye on your financial activities: the Expense Tracker Application. 
Budgeting is now easier and more insightful than ever thanks to our carefully crafted application, which offers customers a smooth and easy experience while tracking their spending.
Ensuring clean and maintainable code was a priority. I followed Swift's best practices, documented my code comprehensively, and implemented automated testing to identify and rectify issues promptly.

While this project was a solo effort, I employed Agile methodologies to manage my tasks and meet deadlines effectively. I also tracked my progress using tools like Trello and Git for version control.
